Update from today ‚Äì 10 months have passed and the groundwater contamination crisis, not very far from where I live, remains out of control.
This was caused by a wastewater treatment facility that collapsed, putting our groundwater at risk and potentially contaminating the Shikma reservoir, which channels floodwaters into the coastal aquifer we all depend on. I'm worried that as time passes, environmental remediation will become more challenging. How can we know the extent of pollution in our groundwater reservoir? üåç

Just last year in northern Tel Aviv, my hydrogeology team and I drilled boreholes to install piezometers for groundwater monitoring.

I've found that while it might seem easier to skip fieldwork and use numerical models to simulate contaminant flow (I used finite element methods for my master's thesis), the truth is that when we're dealing with messy, real-world environmental data, we absolutely need actual field measurements to verify if our models make any sense.

That's why I conducted laboratory flow cell experiments and compared those results to the numerical model - to make sure the calculations reflected what was really happening. üìä

The video shows our team drilling boreholes to install piezometers. I've learned that connecting theory with actual hydrogeological conditions requires this combination of hands-on fieldwork and analytical modeling to truly understand groundwater systems. ‚õèÔ∏è
