Quantifying and predicting fluid flow and chemical transport in hydrological catchments are complicated
by the number of interacting mechanisms, the types and diversity of structural, hydraulic, biogeochemical
parameters, and the uncertainty in estimating or measuring system parameters that control system behavior. In
a catchment system, the land surface, the vadose zone, and the groundwater region contribute to the flow and
transport of substances through the upper soil layer to the deeper aquifer, and in some cases, back to the land
surface.

Large-scale catchment modeling and field measurements are well-documented, but many aspects of
fluid flow and chemical transport remain uncertain. Clear conceptual models are needed to characterize the
relative effective contributions of water and chemicals on the catchment zones, as well as water and chemical
interactions between them. This research aims to characterize and quantify primary processes and variables
governing chemical transport in systems representative of catchment-groundwater systems, using a
combination of laboratory flow cell experiments and numerical modeling.
Experiments were carried out in a laboratory flow cell containing a porous medium and in each experiment
two consecutive rainfall events were carried out. COMSOL Multiphysics software was used to develop a 2-
D, finite element model to represent the laboratory experiments. The numerical model solved two coupled
governing equations: Darcyâ€™s law was used to determine the velocity field and the advection-dispersion
equation (ADE) was used to describe tracer movement. The model was adjusted by modifying free parameters
to match the experiments, and then used to simulate flow and transport dynamics in the system with different
parameters (water content, water table levels and fluid flow direction).
Results were analyzed by (i) examining streamlines and contour maps of dye concentrations entering the
domain from inlet groundwater and rainfall events, (ii) examining inlet and outlet region BTCs for cases in
which groundwater flow is either in the direction of, or opposite to, the decreasing surface slope, and (iii) using
the calibrated model to further examine the impact of water content in the partially saturated zone from the
land surface to the groundwater table.

The main conclusions from this study are as follows. Simulations of three zones in an idealized
groundwater-catchment system can effectively describe the measured flow and transport behavior in a
laboratory-scale experimental flow cell, at least for relatively homogeneous hydraulic conductivity domains.
According to sensitivity tests, modifying the dispersion coefficient has little impact on flow and transport
dynamics in these flow scenarios, while varying water retention parameters can have a significant impact. An
increased water content in a domain increases the time required to flush a tracer out of the system, at least in
the scenarios considered here, and also impacts mixing of fluids from different sources. Finally, the essentially
identical BTC results for groundwater flow in the direction of and opposite to the direction of decreasing
surface slope indicate that the flow direction has negligible effect on the transport dynamics for the laboratoryscale system considered here.
