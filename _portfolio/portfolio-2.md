The United States planted approximately 941,000 acres of potatoes this season in 2024 (USDA)ü•î. According to the FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization), the USA produced 17.8 million tons of potatoes in 2022, placing it third in the world after China (375 million tons) and India (56 million tons). 

As the 2024 potato growing season in the US ends, I'd like to share an interesting challenge in precision agriculture using computer vision that I've been working on: distinguishing between broadleaf and grass-type weeds.üå±

This distinction is critical for effective weed management because broadleaf and grass weeds require different herbicide treatments. Accurate identification enables growers to make data-driven spraying decisions.

Russian thistle is an excellent example of a tricky broadleaf weed species that is difficult to classify. Because the leaf shape is similar to grasses, it can result in high false negatives (FN) and low recall.

Using techniques such as image segmentation and pattern recognition, it is possible to detect small differences in patterns that distinguish between classifying a tag as broadleaf or grass weed, even under diverse field conditions.üåç
