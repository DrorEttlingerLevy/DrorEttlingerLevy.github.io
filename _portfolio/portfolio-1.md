When using remote sensing data to train machine learning models, I find it important to understand how the sensors work and how the data is collected. üîç

For soil moisture sensors, here are some interesting key points:

-Capacitor-based (AC) sensors are more reliable than resistor-based (DC) sensors because they avoid problems like corrosion and sensitivity to ions.

-These sensors work using Parasitic Capacitance (Fringe Capacitance), where the sensor's circuit board acts like a capacitor, helping to measure soil moisture.

-They perform signal conversion using components like the 555 Timer IC, RC integrator, and AC to DC rectifier.

Understanding these aspects helps in detecting anomalies in the data that could suggest something is not working properly, which is especially important for IoT applications and machine learning models in agriculture.ü™¥
