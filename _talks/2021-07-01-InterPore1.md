It was part of the InterPore Israel Chapter meeting‚Äîa branch of the International Society for Porous Media, which brings together researchers working on natural and industrial porous systems. 
The chapter, co-founded by Asst. Prof. Alexandros Terzis from the Technion, held its first meeting at Tel Aviv University in July 2021 with over 60 participants. These gatherings aim to spark collaboration across disciplines, offering a space for sharing both new results and ongoing challenges.
