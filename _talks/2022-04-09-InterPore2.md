 As Head of the organizing committee for the second Israel Chapter Meeting of InterPore, I led the planning of a really exciting event that brought together researchers from all sorts of backgrounds, all connected by their work on porous media. It was a full day of talks, posters, and great conversations.

As the student representative of the Israel Chapter, I was Head of the organizing committee. Together with my fellow colleagues, we were responsible for selecting speakers from a wide range of porous media-related research and coordinating the event.

The second Israel chapter of the InterPore conference was held at the Weizmann Institute of Science on September 18; about fifty researchers and academicians from throughout the nation attended. During the day, students gave lectures on a vast array of porous media-related research from various viewpoints. In addition, there was an interesting poster session where new research works were presented. The conference encouraged collaboration and knowledge sharing between researchers and students, and we look forward to sharing next yearâ€™s meeting.

The organization of the chapter was led by the student representative of the Israel Chapter, Dror Ettlinger from the Weizmann Institute of Science, and her committee members Yanjing Wei from Tel Aviv University, Mario del Mastro from the Technion, Arnold Bacharach from the Technion, and Sayan Sen from Ben Gurion University. We also thank Prof. Brian Berkowitz and the Weizmann institute for financing the conference.
