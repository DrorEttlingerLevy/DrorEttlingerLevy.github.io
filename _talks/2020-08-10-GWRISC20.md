  I presented a poster on a study that uncovers how seawater flows through coastal aquifers by tracking chemical changes like strontium enrichment to reveal hidden underwater pathways. ðŸŒŠ

This poster explores how seawater circulates through coastal aquifers by studying the Indian River Bay in Delaware. Using seepage meters, piezometers, and chemical analysis, the researchers traced the long-term flow patterns of seawater. By focusing on changes in elements like Sr, Ca, and K, they showed that Sr enrichment, linked to water-rock interactions, reveals the direction and structure of the flow path. This helps better understand submarine groundwater discharge and its role in ocean chemistry.
